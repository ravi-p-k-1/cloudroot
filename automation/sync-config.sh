# Copies 4 config values (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY,
# CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN, CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID) from a local env file into a
# repo's GitHub Actions config, via the GitHub CLI.
#
# Lives here in CloudRoot/automation/, not inside any one repo's worker/
# folder: without moving it, CloudRoot/automation is usable by agents working
# in adjacent repos on different local ports (cloudflare on 8888, webroot on
# 8887, etc.) via a relative path like ../CloudRoot/automation/sync-config.sh,
# instead of each repo needing its own duplicate copy.
#
# Usage: ./sync-config.sh [path-to-env-file] [github-owner/repo]
# Default env file path (when no path is passed, or "paths.yaml" is passed
# literally as a placeholder meaning "use the remembered default") comes
# from paths.yaml's env_file: key, next to this script. paths.yaml is
# generated/updated by this script itself, not hand-maintained: the first
# time it doesn't exist yet, this asks for a path outright — no path is
# assumed. After that (or if you pass a real path as the first argument),
# the choice is remembered as the new default for next time. It's
# machine-local (gitignored), so each person's own choice stays their own.
#
# If the file you point at doesn't exist yet, this asks before creating it
# from automation/.env.example (the canonical sample env file committed in
# this folder) rather than silently bootstrapping whatever path was typed -
# see the placeholder-values warning further down for why the script then
# stops instead of syncing straight from that fresh file.
#
# Passing "paths.yaml" as the first argument (rather than a real path) is
# how to override just the second argument (the target repo) while still
# using the remembered env file - the alternative, ./sync-config.sh ""
# owner/repo, works too but is easy to mistype or misread.
