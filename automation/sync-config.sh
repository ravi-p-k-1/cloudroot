# Copies 5 config values (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY,
# CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN, CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID, ORACLE_API_TOKEN) from a
# local env file into a repo's GitHub Actions config, via the GitHub CLI.
#
# Lives here in CloudRoot/automation/, not inside any one repo's worker/
# folder: without moving it, CloudRoot/automation is usable by agents working
# in adjacent repos on different local ports (cloudflare on 8888, webroot on
# 8887, etc.) via a relative path like ../CloudRoot/automation/sync-config.sh,
# instead of each repo needing its own duplicate copy.
#
# Usage: ./sync-config.sh [path-to-env-file] [github-owner/repo]
# Default env file path (when no path is passed, or "paths.yaml" is passed
# literally as a placeholder meaning "use the remembered default") comes
# from paths.yaml's env_file: key, next to this script. paths.yaml is
# generated/updated by this script itself, not hand-maintained: the first
# time it doesn't exist yet, this prompts before assuming the fallback
# (../../safe/cloudroot.env, a folder outside any git repo); after that (or
# if you pass a real path as the first argument), the choice is remembered
# as the new default for next time. It's machine-local (gitignored), so
# each person's own choice stays their own.
#
# If the fallback path specifically doesn't exist yet, it's created from
# ModelEarth/docker's .env.example template (fetched via curl/wget) rather
# than erroring - see the placeholder-values warning further down for why
# the script then stops instead of syncing straight from that fresh file.
#
# Passing "paths.yaml" as the first argument (rather than a real path) is
# how to override just the second argument (the target repo) while still
# using the remembered env file - the alternative, ./sync-config.sh ""
# owner/repo, works too but is easy to mistype or misread.
